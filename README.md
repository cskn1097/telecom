## General Information
You have a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers. The main types of attributes are:

Demographics (age, gender etc.)
Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)
Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)
 

Based on all this past information, you want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. It is a binary variable - 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned.
